This is better than simply calling an emergency meeting because it can be used during special situations too like sabotages

Type: **Button**

## Host-Only
While the other cheats work even though you aren't the game's host, these cheats will only be accessible to you if you are hosting a game

This is because the Among Us anticheat system doesn't detect most cheats if you are a host, so you have more hacking freedom.
